# Tinkers Construct Materials Guide

> A web app designed to make Tinkers' Tool Designing Easy!

I'm developing this web app to make designing Tinkers' tools easier for myself and for anyone else who wants to use it. This tool will allow users to quickly browse, compare, and plan out their custom tools for various versions of Tinkers' Construct.

### CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT

My first build will be based on Tinkers' 1.12.2, with Tinker Alloying Addon, and primarily based on the MC Eternal modpack. Eventually, I will add support for other versions and try to add as many materials as I can find supported by Tinkers.

### PLANNED FEATURES
- [X] **Materials List**: A sortable and searchable list of materials for different versions.
  - [X] Filter by durability, mining speed, attack damage, and other stats.
  - [X] Search by name, mod, or modifiers.
