# Tinkers Construct Materials Guide
> A webapp designed to make Tinkers' Tool Designing Easy!

I'm developing this webapp to make designing tinkers' tool easier for myself and for anyone else who wants to use it.

### CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT

My first build will be based on Tinker's 1.12.2, with Tinker Alloying Addon, and mainly based on MC Eternal (Modpack I'm currently playing)
Eventually I will add support for other versions, and try to add as many materials as I can find supported by Tinkers
